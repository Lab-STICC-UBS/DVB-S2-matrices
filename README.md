# DVB-S2-matrices
Matlab tools to convert matrices defined in standard to parity check matrix or Quasi Cyclic matrices 

* **DVB_S2_to_QC.m**: Convert matrices defined in DVB-S2 standard to Quasi Cyclic prototype matrix
* **DVB-S2_to_parity.m**: Convert from DVB standard to parity matrix
* **H_to_DVBS2.m**: Convert from parity check matrix to DVB-S2 like matrix
* **parityDVB_to_QC.m** : Convert from parity H from DVB-S2_to_parity.m to a reordered Quasic cyclic parity check matrix
* **parity_to_alist.m** : Convert parity matrix to alist format
* **parity_to_DVBS2.m** : Convert from DVB-S2 like H matrix to a table as in DVB-S2 standard
